# ICARGO MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
## Project Title: 
    Cargo Screening ML
## Description:
The Cargo Screening ML project is an advanced cargo inspection system that leverages machine learning techniques to enhance the safety and efficiency of cargo screening at airports and logistics hubs. This system is designed to assist airlines cargo management and security personnel by automating the screening process and providing detailed screening information based on an airway bill number.

## Features:

### Airway Bill Input:
 Users can input an airway bill number, which uniquely identifies a cargo shipment.
### Machine Learning Screening: 
The system employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze cargo contents and identify potential security risks.
### Screening Details:
 Upon inputting an airway bill number, the system returns comprehensive screening details, including:
    Cargo Contents: A detailed list of items within the cargo shipment.
    Security Assessment: Risk assessment based on cargo content analysis.
    Screening History: screening method, screening date and time, screening location/facility,screener details,  for the given cargo.
## Benefits:

Enhanced Security: By utilizing machine learning, the project improves cargo screening accuracy and reduces the risk of security breaches.
Efficiency: Automation streamlines the cargo screening process, saving time and resources.
Transparency: Users gain access to detailed cargo screening reports, promoting transparency and accountability.
## Use Cases:

### Airport Cargo Screening: 
Expedite the inspection of cargo shipments at airports while maintaining a high level of security.
### Logistics and Freight Companies: 
Improve cargo handling and risk assessment for logistics and freight operations.
## Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python 3.9
Machine Learning Frameworks: pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib,scikit-learn,catboost,xgboost
Web Interface: Flask (for a user-friendly web interface)
Database: PostgreSQL (for storing screening data)
Deployment: Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
 
## Getting Started:
To use the Cargo Screening ML system, simply enter the airway bill number of the cargo shipment you wish to screen. The system will then provide you with detailed screening results and recommendations.

## Disclaimer:
This project is intended for demonstration purposes and as a proof-of-concept for cargo screening automation. It is not intended for real-world cargo security applications without appropriate validation and certification.
